Project Etch-A-Sketch 


Developer: Luy Vannda

 Weâ€™re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. In this project we eventually come up with two different version.
 
 The main branch will be focused on touch devices at a mobile friendly website.
 Due to the in compatibility of color picker. We somehow end up with a work around with a message asking user to touch outside of the box in order for the color picker to work correctly. In the future when my skill as the web developer improve I hope to build a more touch friendly devices with custom color picker that support touch event.  

 The pc_version branch is work best with mouse and keyboard.
