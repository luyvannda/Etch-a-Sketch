Project Etch-A-Sketch 


Developer: Luy Vannda

 Weâ€™re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. In this project we eventually come up with two different version.
 
 The main branch will be focused on touch devices at a mobile friendly website.
   
 The pc_version branch is work best with mouse and keyboard.
